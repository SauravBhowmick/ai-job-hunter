### Setting Up Your Profile

1. Sign up or log in using OAuth (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, etc.)
2. Complete your profile with skills, experience, and preferences
3. Set your preferred job titles and locations
4. Configure your notification email

### Browsing and Applying

1. View automatically scored job listings
2. Filter by relevance score, location, and source
3. Apply manually with custom cover letters, or enable auto-apply
4. Track your application status through the dashboard

| `auth.logout` | Log out user |
| `profile.get` | Get user profile |
| `profile.update` | Update profile |
| `jobs.list` | List jobs with scores |
| `jobs.refresh` | Refresh job listings |
| `applications.list` | List applications |
| `applications.submitApplication` | Apply to a job |

## How It Works

### Job Relevance Scoring

Jobs are scored based on keyword matching:

| Priority | Points | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| High | 10 | data scientist, machine learning, energy systems |
| Medium | 5 | data analyst, automation, research |
| Low | 2 | engineer, scientist, researcher |
| User skills | 8 | Based on your profile |

Scores are normalized to a 0 to 100 range.

### Auto-Apply Pattern Matching

The system learns from your manual applications:

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Matched keywords (2+) | 40 |
| Company match | 30 |
| Location match | 20 |
| Text content match | Up to 30 |

Jobs with 70% or higher pattern confidence are auto-applied.
